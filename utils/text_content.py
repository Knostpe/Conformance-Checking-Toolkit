Dear Participants,

We appreciate your willingness to participate in this research, which aims to assess the effectiveness of our prototype in supporting the visual representation of conformance checking results.

The prototype was created to aid users in extracting insights from conformance checking data. 
When using visual analytics in the context of conformance checking, your feedback will be critical in understanding user expectations.

Please complete the survey, which should still be open in another tab, and participate in the tasks provided. Thank you for your time and effort.

conformance_checking_introduction = """
Conformance checking is a process used in the field of process mining and business process management to assess the alignment between observed process 
behavior and the expected or intended behavior of a process. It involves comparing real-world execution traces of a process, often captured in event logs, 
with a predefined process model or specification.

The main goal of conformance checking is to identify and quantify discrepancies or deviations between the observed process executions and the expected 
behavior. These discrepancies are often referred to as "violations" or "deviations" and can highlight potential inefficiencies, non-compliance with regulations, or 
opportunities for process improvement.

Conformance checking is an essential tool for organizations seeking to gain insights into their business processes' actual execution and identify 
areas for optimization and compliance assurance. The results of conformance checking help process analysts and managers make data-driven decisions to 
enhance process performance, identify bottlenecks, and ensure adherence to process standards.
